# CakeApp Contracts

CakeApp (trycake.xyz) is a smart-contract deployer and management platform for brands looking to onboard to web3.

The CAKE721 contract attempts to provide clients as much optionality as it relates to the kinds of applications they wish to build atop one or many NFT collections. It is the first of many future contracts that brands can leverage within CakeApp to grow their business and presence in the web3 world.
